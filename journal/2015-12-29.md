## Activities
* Observed and photographed lemon tree

## Lemon tree observations
* Saw line of ants going up and down trunk and moving through tree. They seem to cluster on certain leaves and also on some of the lemons, but mostly are hard to find away from the trunk itself. When on leaves, they tend to be on the underside of those with white, fluffy, cottony material (related to scale insect eggs?) but not the ones with the most dense scale infestations.
* Most leaves have some degree of scale presence visible on underside. Some have very dense infestations, with combination of brown scales, white fluffy material, and black dots (eggs?). Some just have white, fluffy material.
* Most leaves also have black coating on top. This is also on much of the bark and the lemons.
* Despite infestation, the tree is producing many lemons - more than I have ever seen on it at one time.
